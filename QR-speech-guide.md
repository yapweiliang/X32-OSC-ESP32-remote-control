# X32 Supervillian Gizmo

Date: `12 April 2023`

Follow this guide if you need to set up the `X32` for general speech.

1. Turn on the sound system (see printed guide if needed).

2. Turn on this box by flicking the mode switch down to `NORMAL MODE`.

>    If it is not working, the battery is probably depleted.
>    Connect a suitable USB cable to supply power.
>
>    *OPTIONAL:* If you wish to charge the battery, the mode switch **must** be at `NORMAL MODE`.

3. Wait for the **green** indicator to change from ***flashing*** to ***solid*** green (this means the WiFi is connected).

4. Press and hold down the **yellow** button for at least `3` seconds; release the button after the second flash.

6. The task is now complete, therefore **please turn off this box to conserve the battery for the next user**.  It is no-longer needed for the session.

The following will be enabled:

1. Lectern microphone
2. Tie-clip microphone
3. Both handheld microphones
4. HDMI sound (for laptop)

The band microphones/instruments will be disabled.

When the meeting is finished, please remember to turn off the sound system (see printed guide if needed).

*Thank you.*
